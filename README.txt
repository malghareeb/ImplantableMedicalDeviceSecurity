ImplantableMedicalDeviceSecurity
================================

This repository is for COSC 745 Advance Security Group project. 
The project title is: Security and Privacy of Wireless Implantable Medical Devices. 
For this project we are going to simulate an Implantable medical device's ability to send and recieve data wirelessly.
The primary goal of this project is to evaluate the security and privacy of the wireless communicaiton and prove that the secuirty of the device communication is effective and the privacy of the patient data is protected. 
We are going to use Encryption, virtural machine (to act as the device which is custome built to memick the device charastristic), and wireshark to capture the data being sent.

Security & Privacy (evalution + attacks):
In this expirement, we are going to evalute the security and the defense machanisms against these attacks:
1- Passive Man In The Middle attack (MITM).
2- Denial of Service attacks (DoS).
Furthermore, we are going to evalute the privacy of patient info and check the compliance of HIPAA for these issues:
1- Measurement and log privacy.
2- Bearer privacy.

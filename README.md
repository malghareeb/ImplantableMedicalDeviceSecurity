ImplantableMedicalDeviceSecurity
================================

This repository is for COSC 745 Adv. Security Group project. 
The project title is: Security and Privacy of Wireless Implantable Medical Devices. 
For this project we are going to simulate an Implantable medical device's ability to send and recieve data wirelessly.
The primary goal of this project is to evaluate the security and privacy of the wireless communicaiton and prove that the secuirty of the device communication is affective and the privacy of the patient data is protected. 
We are going to use Encryption, virtural machine (to act as the device and custome built to memick the device), and wireshark to capture the data being sent.

Security & Privacy (evalution + attacks):
In this expirement, we are going to evalute the security and the defense machanisims against these attacks:
1- Passive Man In The Middle attack (MITM).
2- Denial of Service attacks (DoS).
Furthremore, we are going to evalute the privacy of these issues:
1- Measurement and log privacy.
2- Bearer privacy.
